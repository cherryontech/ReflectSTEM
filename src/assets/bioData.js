      career: `In her 2023 Smith College commencement speech, Reshma shared about her upbringing as the child of Indian refugees living in the U.S. She recalled feeling isolated because no one else looked like her; she had no one to identify with. This feeling remained with her even in her successful career as an attorney.
      Reshma said imposter syndrome makes us look like the problem, but we’re not. She is committed to female empowerment because she said we have a broken system that makes us feel we’re not enough when we are. So it’s up to us to fix the system.`,
