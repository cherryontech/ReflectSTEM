- **Responsive Design:** Styled with TailwindCSS for a responsive layout, ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience across various device sizes.

- **Optimized Performance:** The application is structured with a focus on performance, including efficient state management and the use of React's `useRef` hook to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
